# About
Health Data Science at the University of Plymouth is an interdisciplinary research programme, building upon our expertise in big data, mathematics, statistics, high performance computing and their applications in health and care. We work closely with NHS trusts, health and care organisations, industry and the third sector. Our vision is to develop and use data science approaches to improve health and care for patient and public benefit. For further information, please contact [Dr Yinghui Wei](mailto:yinghui.wei@plymouth.ac.uk).

# Workshops
The [Health Data Science Research Group](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/health-data-science-research), supported by EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account, is organising [workshops](#workshops) under the broad theme of __using data and analytical approaches to improve healthcare services for patient and public benefit__. The aim of these workshops is to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world practice through providing opportunities for academic staff and non-academic partners to showcase their work and exchange knowledge. 

These workshops provide great opportunities to share expertise and facilitate academia-industry research collaborations, as well as to co-design postgraduate projects aligned to priority areas in health and care in the real world. If you would like to attend the workshop, please contact [Dr Yinghui Wei](mailto:yinghui.wei@plymouth.ac.uk).
