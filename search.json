    "text": "Health Data Science at the University of Plymouth is an interdisciplinary research programme, building upon our expertise in big data, mathematics, statistics, high performance computing and their applications in health and care. We work closely with NHS trusts, health and care organisations, industry and the third sector. Our vision is to use data science approaches to improve health and care for patient and public benefit.\nThe Health Data Science Research Group, supported by EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account, is organising workshops under the broad theme of using data and analytical approaches to improve healthcare services for patient and public benefit. The aim of these workshops is to bridge the gap between research and practice through providing opportunities for academic staff and non-academic partners to showcase their work and exchange knowledge.\nThese workshops are a great opportunity to share expertise and facilitate collaborations, as well as leading to various project opportunities for postgraduate students. For further information or if you would like to get involved, please contact Dr Yinghui Wei."
